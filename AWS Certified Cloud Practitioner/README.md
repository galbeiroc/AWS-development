# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification is one of the most popular certifications in cloud computing today. Cloud adoption is growing at an ever increasing rate and a shortage of skilled staff is driving up the value of cloud certifications. It’s important for personnel in many areas of the business to understand the cloud value proposition and how it can drive business value.

## AWS Pricing

### Pay-as-you-go

With AWS you only pay for what use, helping your organization remain agile, responsive and always able to meet scale demands.

Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.

### Flat rate

Flat-rate plans combine multiple AWS services into one price with no overage charges, giving you the reliability and security of AWS with simple monthly billing. As your needs grow, you can easily upgrade to plans with more capabilities and larger usage allowances.

### Save when you commit

For AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning, Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in $/hour) of an AWS service or a category of services, for a one- or three-year period.

### Pay less by using more

With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that allow you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.
